This file stores a few small tips for developers.

=== Starting from a fresh copy ===

When you have just retrieved echoping via Subversion (this does not
apply to regular tarballs), you must first create all the files
required by the autotools. You need these autotools (autoconf,
automake and libtool) and then:

./recreate-autofiles

=== Merging from a maintenance branch back into the trunk ===

If you have fixed bugs in a branch and want to merge them into the
trunk as well:

cd /where/is/the/trunk
svn merge -r N:M ../branches/MAINT_X_Y
