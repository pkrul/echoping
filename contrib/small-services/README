small-services is an echoping plugin which implements the following
network services: 

* echo (RFC 862)
* discard (RFC 863)
* chargen (RFC 864)

As of today (2007-12-21), these services are in the main echoping tree
but the idea is to move them to this plugin in the future. See
echoping Feature Request #1694557 at Sourceforge.
